# 📧 Spam Email Detection Using Machine Learning

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to build a system that classifies email messages as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)**. It also features a user-friendly **Streamlit web app** for real-time message testing and model retraining.

## 🚀 Features

* 🧹 Data cleaning and preprocessing
* 🧠 TF-IDF vectorization of email text
* 🤖 Trained with Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier
* 📊 Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix
* 🌐 Interactive Streamlit web app
